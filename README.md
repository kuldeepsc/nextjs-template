This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### A beautiful Starter UI Kit in NextJS.

Start your development with a Free ArdorNext and NextJS UI Kit and bootstrap. Let ArdorNext NextJS amaze you with its cool features and build tools and get your project to a whole new level.

ArdorNext NextJS is Free and Open Source. It features multiple HTML and NextJS elements and it comes with dynamic components for NextJS.

It is based on [Bootstrap & JSX]

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3070](http://localhost:3070) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3070/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
